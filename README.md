# Wireless-Power-Transmission-Project-
Proof of concept for Wireless Power Transfer using inductive coupling. For this project I used a 555 timer IC to create an oscillating current that was fed to a resonating LC tank. THe inductor coil then induced a current in the other coil and i rectified the AC current to DC current to feed the LED.
